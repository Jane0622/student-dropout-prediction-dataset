# Student-Dropout-Prediction-Dataset

ðŸ“Š Predicting academic dropout and success using real-world student data and Python-based analysis.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

This project investigates dropout trends and academic success among 4,424 students using real data from higher education records. The goal was to uncover early indicators of academic risk through feature engineering and data visualization.

As the **primary analyst**, I led:
- Data wrangling and cleanup
- Outlier detection and capping (IQR method)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using histograms, KDE plots, box/violin plots
- Feature engineering (approval rates, average grades, grade change)
- Visual storytelling using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Correlation analysis and strip/scatter plots to uncover relationships

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

## ðŸ—ƒ Files Included
- `Progress_Report_1.ipynb` â€“ Cleaned notebook with full EDA and visualizations
- `Progress Report #1 - Colab.pdf` â€“ Exported PDF of the report

## ðŸš€ Key Insights
- **Dropouts** are strongly linked to low 2nd semester grades and low approval rates
- **Early academic performance** is a strong predictor of future success
- **Marital status and course load** showed additional influence on outcomes
